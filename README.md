# **TipPredictor**

TipPredictor is an AI-powered machine learning system designed to predict tip amounts for waiters based on customer, bill, and dining details. By leveraging multiple regression algorithms and structured data processing, this system provides accurate predictions, helping restaurants optimize service strategies and understand tipping behavior.

## Objective

Tipping behavior is influenced by factors such as total bill, party size, day, time, and customer demographics. TipPredictor analyzes these key factors to estimate expected tips, empowering waitstaff and restaurant managers to make data-driven decisions and improve customer experience.

## Features

* **Multi-Model Evaluation:** Compares six regression algorithms to select the most reliable model.
* **Categorical Feature Encoding:** Converts non-numeric features into machine-readable formats for better model performance.
* **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates models using RÂ², MAE, and RMSE for robust assessment.
* **Scalable and Extensible:** Can incorporate additional features like customer ratings or loyalty data for improved prediction accuracy.

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

The system uses structured data with the following features:

**Numerical Features:**

* `total_bill` â€“ Total bill amount
* `size` â€“ Number of people in the party

**Categorical Features:**

* `sex` â€“ Male â†’ 1, Female â†’ 0
* `smoker` â€“ Yes â†’ 1, No â†’ 0
* `day` â€“ Sun â†’ 4, Sat â†’ 3, Thur â†’ 1, Fri â†’ 2
* `time` â€“ Dinner â†’ 2, Lunch â†’ 1

**Encoding Strategy:**

* **Label Encoding:** For binary categories like `sex` and `smoker`.
* **Mapping:** For multi-class features like `day` and `time`.


## **Distribution of Group Sizes**

The dataset shows that most orders are from parties of **2 people**, with 156 occurrences, making it the most common group size. Medium-sized groups of **3 and 4 people** have 38 and 37 orders respectively, while single-person and large parties of **5 or 6 people** are rare, with only 4â€“5 orders each. This distribution is likely because small groups, such as couples or friends dining together, are more frequent in restaurants, whereas very large parties are less common. Understanding this pattern helps analyze tipping behavior and how party size may influence tip amounts.


## **Evaluation Metrics**

Evaluation metrics help measure how well the regression model predicts tips. The main metrics used in TipPredictor are:

* **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination):** Shows how much of the variation in the tip is explained by the model. Higher values (closer to 1) are better.
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** The average difference between predicted and actual tips. Lower values mean more accurate predictions.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Shows the spread of prediction errors, giving more weight to larger mistakes. Lower values indicate better performance.

These metrics give a clear idea of the modelâ€™s accuracy and reliability.

## Machine Learning Models and Performance

| Model                       | RÂ²     | MAE  | RMSE |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Linear Regression           | 0.4429 | 0.67 | 0.83 |
| Random Forest Regressor     | 0.2481 | 0.77 | 0.97 |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor | 0.3475 | 0.74 | 0.90 |
| XGBoost Regressor           | 0.1808 | 0.73 | 1.01 |
| CatBoost Regressor          | 0.3942 | 0.69 | 0.87 |
| LightGBM Regressor          | 0.3769 | 0.72 | 0.88 |

**Best Performing Model:** Linear Regression, achieving the highest combined score (RÂ² = 0.4429), is selected as the primary model due to its simplicity and reliable performance.

## **Best Model: Actual vs Predicted Tips Plot**

The plot above illustrates the comparison between the **actual tip amounts** (x-axis) and the **predicted tip values** (y-axis) generated by the Linear Regression model. Each blue dot represents a single observation from the test dataset. The **red dashed line** represents the ideal scenario where the predicted and actual values are perfectly aligned (i.e., prediction = actual). Points lying close to this line indicate accurate predictions, while points farther away show deviations or prediction errors.

From the visualization, it can be observed that most data points are scattered close to the red line, suggesting that the model is performing reasonably well in estimating tips. However, the spread of points increases for higher tip values, indicating that the modelâ€™s accuracy slightly decreases as the tip amount grows. Overall, the Linear Regression model effectively captures the general relationship between total bill and tip, making it a good baseline model for this dataset.



## Prediction Workflow

1. **Input Data:** User provides bill and customer details.

2. **Data Processing:** Categorical values are encoded into numeric format.

3. **Model Execution:** The pre-trained regression model evaluates the expected tip.

4. **Prediction Output:** Displays the predicted tip amount.
