# **TipPredictor**

## Overview

TipPredictor is an AI-powered machine learning system designed to predict tip amounts for waiters based on customer, bill, and dining details. By leveraging multiple regression algorithms and structured data processing, this system provides accurate predictions, helping restaurants optimize service strategies and understand tipping behavior.

## Objective

Tipping behavior is influenced by factors such as total bill, party size, day, time, and customer demographics. TipPredictor analyzes these key factors to estimate expected tips, empowering waitstaff and restaurant managers to make data-driven decisions and improve customer experience.

## Features

* **Multi-Model Evaluation:** Compares six regression algorithms to select the most reliable model.
* **Categorical Feature Encoding:** Converts non-numeric features into machine-readable formats for better model performance.
* **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates models using RÂ², MAE, and RMSE for robust assessment.
* **Scalable and Extensible:** Can incorporate additional features like customer ratings or loyalty data for improved prediction accuracy.

## Machine Learning Models and Performance

| Model                       | RÂ²     | MAE  | RMSE |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Linear Regression           | 0.4429 | 0.67 | 0.83 |
| Random Forest Regressor     | 0.2481 | 0.77 | 0.97 |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor | 0.3475 | 0.74 | 0.90 |
| XGBoost Regressor           | 0.1808 | 0.73 | 1.01 |
| CatBoost Regressor          | 0.3942 | 0.69 | 0.87 |
| LightGBM Regressor          | 0.3769 | 0.72 | 0.88 |

**Best Performing Model:** Linear Regression, achieving the highest combined score (RÂ² = 0.4429), is selected as the primary model due to its simplicity and reliable performance.

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

The system uses structured data with the following features:

**Numerical Features:**

* `total_bill` â€“ Total bill amount
* `size` â€“ Number of people in the party

**Categorical Features:**

* `sex` â€“ Male â†’ 1, Female â†’ 0
* `smoker` â€“ Yes â†’ 1, No â†’ 0
* `day` â€“ Sun â†’ 4, Sat â†’ 3, Thur â†’ 1, Fri â†’ 2
* `time` â€“ Dinner â†’ 2, Lunch â†’ 1

**Encoding Strategy:**

* **Label Encoding:** For binary categories like `sex` and `smoker`.
* **Mapping:** For multi-class features like `day` and `time`.

## Prediction Workflow

1. **Input Data:** User provides bill and customer details.

2. **Data Processing:** Categorical values are encoded into numeric format.

3. **Model Execution:** The pre-trained regression model evaluates the expected tip.

4. **Prediction Output:** Displays the predicted tip amount.
